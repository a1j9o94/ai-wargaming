# AI Wargaming System Architecture

## System Overview
The AI Wargaming platform is a modern web application built with Next.js, featuring real-time simulation capabilities and an advanced UI inspired by military command centers.

## Core Components

### Frontend Layer
- **Next.js App Router**: Main application framework
- **shadcn/ui**: Primary UI component library
- **State Management**: React Context + Zustand for global state
- **Real-time Updates**: Server-sent events / WebSocket connections

### Backend Layer
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for backend functionality
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user management
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration for simulation intelligence

### Key Modules
1. **Command Center**
   - Main dashboard interface
   - Real-time battle visualization
   - Command input system

2. **Simulation Engine**
   - AI-driven battle simulation
   - Real-time state management
   - Event processing system

3. **Analytics Module**
   - Battle statistics tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - Historical data analysis

4. **User Management**
   - Authentication system
   - User profiles
   - Permissions management

## Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger events in the Command Center
2. Events are processed through the Simulation Engine
3. AI systems evaluate and respond to changes
4. Real-time updates are pushed to all connected clients
5. Analytics data is captured and stored

## Deployment Architecture
- Vercel for frontend hosting
- PostgreSQL database (hosted)
- WebSocket service for real-time communications
- AI service integration via API

## Security Considerations
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting on API routes
- Encrypted websocket connections
- Environment-based secrets management
